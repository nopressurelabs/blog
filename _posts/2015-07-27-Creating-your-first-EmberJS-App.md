A couple of [http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Barcelona/events/223198909/](weeks ago) we reloaded the local EmberJS Barcelona meetup. 
For the occasion I wrote a quick application to show everyone how easy it easy to start developing with EmberJS. 
The idea was to recreate the feeling that first time Rails devs get when they start scaffolding. They type a few commands and everything works out of the box.
